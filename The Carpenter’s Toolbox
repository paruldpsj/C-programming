Problem Statement

A carpenter named Mr. Oak is building furniture for a school. He keeps different wooden boards in his workshop, and each board is shaped like a rectangle.

To speed up his work, Mr. Oak wants a small program that can calculate the area and perimeter of any rectangular board he chooses.

Your job is to help him by writing a program using structures and functions.

Your Task

1) Create a structure named Rectangle with:

int length
int width
2) Write two functions:

int getArea(struct Rectangle r)
int getPerimeter(struct Rectangle r)
3) Input a rectangle’s length and width, store them in the structure, and print:

The area
The perimeter
Input Format

You need to enter two numbers:

First line → length of the rectangle
Second line → width of the rectangle
Constraints

1 ≤ length ≤ 10,000
1 ≤ width ≤ 10,000
Output Format

Print the results exactly in this format:

Area: <value>

Perimeter: <value>

Sample Input 0

5
3
Sample Output 0

Area: 15
Perimeter: 16






#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Rectangle{
    int length;
    int width;
};
int getArea(struct Rectangle r){
    return r.length*r.width;
}
int getPerimeter(struct Rectangle r){
    return 2*(r.length+ r.width);
}
int main() {
    struct Rectangle rect;
    scanf("%d", &rect.length);
    scanf("%d", &rect.width);
    printf("Area: %d\n", getArea(rect));
    printf("Perimeter: %d\n", getPerimeter(rect));

   
    return 0;
}
