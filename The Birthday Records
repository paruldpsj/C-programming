Problem Statement

Your school is creating a Digital Birthday Record System.

Each student’s information must include:

Their name
Their date of birth (day, month, year)
To store this properly, you are asked to use nested structures in C.

Your job is to input one student’s basic info and birthday, store it using structures, and print it neatly.

Your Task

1) Create a structure Date with:

int day
int month
int year
2) Create a structure Student with:

char name[50]
struct Date dob
3) Read all student details and print them in the required format.

Input Format

You need to enter four values:

First line: Student’s name
Second line: Day of birth (number)
Third line: Month of birth (number)
Fourth line: Year of birth (number)
Constraints

Name ≤ 50 characters
1 ≤ day ≤ 31
1 ≤ month ≤ 12
1900 ≤ year ≤ 2100
Output Format

You must print the student’s name and date of birth like this:

Name: <name>
Date of Birth: <day>/<month>/<year>
Sample Input 0

Rohan
15
8
2010
Sample Output 0

Name: Rohan
Date of Birth: 15/8/2010






#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Date{
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
};
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    struct Date dob;
};
int main() {
    struct Student s;

    fgets(s.name, 50, stdin);
    s.name[strcspn(s.name, "\n")] = '\0';
    scanf("%d", &s.dob.day);
    scanf("%d", &s.dob.month);
    scanf("%d", &s.dob.year);

    printf("Name: %s\n", s.name);
    printf("Date of Birth: %d/%d/%d", s.dob.day, s.dob.month, s.dob.year);
    return 0;
}
